# AI and Machine Learning

- **Supervised Models**: Data is labelled with a tag, number, name or similar
        - Unsupervised models look at raw data and seeing if it falls into groups naturally


                    ----------------------------
                   |                            |
                   V                            |
        Input -> Model -> Predicted Output -> Error
                                |               ^
                                | **compare**   |
                                V               |
                          Expected Output -------


- **Unsupervised Models**: No tags
        - Supervised uses past examples to predict future values

        Input -> Model -> Generated Example

- **AI Models**
    - y: output = f:function(x: input)
    - Discrimitative - Label ex. Number, Class, Probablility - predictive?
    - Generative - NEW CONTENT - ex. images, text, video - "creates"
        - Generative LANGUAGE models -  TEXT to image, audio, text or other format
        - Transformers - encoder and decoder
            - Encoder takes x and decoder outputs x based on task

## Google's AI products:

- **Vertex AI**: create your own chatbots, didital assistands, training apps etc
- **Gemini**: complex AI tasks

## Data Quality Metrics

- **Relevance**
- **Completeness**
- **Accuracy**
- **Representation**
- **Consistency**

## Data Accessibility

- Availability
- Cost
- Format

## Data Types/Categorizations

- Structured : Think Rows and Columns
- Unstructured : Think documents/free form text, images, music.

- Labeled
    - Has a type, name or number.  Basically is "tagged" or categorized
- Unlabeled
    - Raw, unprocessed info with no meaning, eg. Audio logs, text with no categorization
    - Algorithms built to discover the patterns as there are no labels. 

## Other Concepts

- **Reinforcement Learning**:
    - Learning through interaction and feedback
